# Housing 101: Low-Income Housing and its Relationship to Educational Outcomes
## DATA 205 Capstone Project
### This project looks at the relationship between low-income housing and academic success. Specifically, I focus on the following variables: low-income housing (Moderately Priced Dwelling Units (MPDUs), Housing Opportunities Community-owned housing, and HUD-reported low-income housing units), graduation rates, and free and reduced priced meals (FARMS).
